About the app

The app consists of two pages login and greeting, with greeting being a protected page (you need to be logged in or you will be redirected)
I used React Router 4 to implement external routing and used Redux for state management and redux-thunk to dispatch fake authentication actions.
The pages are responsive and I have tried to focus on the user experience with intuitive css/styles as well as validation on login and some error states.
